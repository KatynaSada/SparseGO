<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 <p align="center"><img src="images/network.png" width="700" alt="Logo"></p>


Artificial intelligence (AI), and specifically Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have been successfully applied to predict drug efficacy in cancer cell lines. However, understanding how the recommendation is carried out, is still a challenge when using DNNs. An algorithm called <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33096023/">DrugCell<a> showed that by simulating the Gene Ontology structure with a DNN, each neuron in the network can be assigned an interpretation. Here we present SparseGO, a sparse explainable neural network that extends this approach in two different ways: first, by optimizing the algorithm using sparse DNNs to accommodate any type of omics data as input, and second, by fusing an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique with another machine learning algorithm to systematically predict the mechanism of action (MoA) of drugs.  

This tutorial includes:
* predict using a trained SparseGO network
* train the network.
* DeepMoA method

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
